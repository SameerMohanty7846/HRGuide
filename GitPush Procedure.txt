Part-4 Collaboration
----------------------
Doubts
-------
1>While working alone in the project should
2>After pull will that new branch going to be present
3>last part fetch or pull required

make a proper notes about each sep


2 users Lead and Developer

=>Lead writes the code for STAGE-0
=>Lead will upoad STAGE-0 CODE IN GIT HUB
=>Lead will add the Developer for collaboration and will tell him to do the changes which he needs
=>Developer has permissions to change the code in GITHUB
=>Developer will take the copy of the STAGE-0 code into his personal laptop
=>No both Developer and Lead has the STAGE-0 CODE
=>Stage-0 is the main code , we will not modify the Stage-0 code directly 


=>Now the developer developed the code whiich is modified code Stage-1 Code on the top of Stage-0 code
=>Developer has done the changes on the code in his own brach not in the mai branch
=>Now Dev will upload the code in GITHUB 
=>Now github is having the code of Stage-0 and Stage-1
=>Now dev will tell the Lead that he has done the changes and uploaded the code into GITHUB
=>Stage 0 and Stage 1 code is present in the GITHUB
=>Lead will download the Code
=>Now Lead is also having Stage-0 Stage-1 code 
=>Dev is also having them
=>In github also same thing present

BUt the thing is Lead will not get those Stage-0 Stage-1 code automatically,
=>Lead must download the codee 


Steps in Gitbash and Github:-
-----------------------------
=>Lead will make the folder structure and will initialize the codes
=>And will upload in Github creating the repository
=>Then Lead will add the collaborators


=>Dev will clone that repo
=>All Devs will create their own branch(The main branch code is never chaged all the changes happen in their specific branch )
=>We will write the code in the same branch which is created
=>After completion he will commit the code means upload or push the code in github
=>Dev will inform the teammates about the changes he has done in the commit

=>Merger/Lead will fetch the code checks it and repushes the code


COMMANDS:-
-----------
Lead
1>will create html css js files in his folder
2>Will create a repository in Github(Just check should both names in remote and in github should be same)
3>Create Rpository without any changes
4>Now follow all the steps from github
5>in 3rd  instructiion  use git add . instead of git add README.md
6>Rest of the steps as it is
=>Now the Lead pushed the code in github
7>Lead will add the collaborators  
   in git hub=>Settings=>collaborators
8>The devs will accept the invitations
9>

Dev
1>First each dev will clone the project
2>git clone==>the repo url
3>when in one folder the project is clone the dev can work on that project
4>The dev before writing a single line of code must create a branch
5>FOr adding and switching a new branch:- git switch -C feature/adding-marquee-effect
6>For viewing total branches present git branch there will be multiple branches and on which * is prsent that is our branch
7>The each and every code we write here goes to that particular branch
8>code in that updated
9>Now the dev will push the code 
          git add .
          git commit -m "added marquee effect"
          git push -u origin feature/adding-marquee-effect
          
          NOw the code is pushed into github with the specific branch name not in the main branch
          There will be a new branch created with the specific name
          =>There is no changes in the main it is just the change in his specific branch
    
10>NOw  the dev will update the Lead that the code isupdated merger it


Lead merging part
---------------------
1>Now the merger will type git fetch
2>now switch to that branch  git switch feature/adding-marquee-effect
3>now after this the code will be visible in the merger laptop
4>lead will change the branch to main branch git switch main
5>git merge feature/adding-marquee-effect
6>Now in main code Devs code has been merged
7>Lead will upload this code into github git push origin main
8>Now the updated code is preseent in github
9>Now the merged is ppreseent in lead and in github but but not with the dev


Dev will get the updated code
--------------------------------
1>Dev will change to main git switch main
2>git fetch
3>git pull======>Now the updated code is also present
